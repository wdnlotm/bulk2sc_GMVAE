## scTAPE 
`scTAPE` is adopted to predict cell type proportions in bulk RNA-seq. The many hyperparameters remains inaccessible in the default interface of `scTAPE` package. The `scTAPE` source codes are modified to make more hyperparameters accessible. A package is created from those modified `scTAPE` source code. To install,
```
pip install dist/scTAPE_for_bulk2scGMVAE-0.1-py3-none-any.whl # run this in _4_model_train_scTAPE
```
