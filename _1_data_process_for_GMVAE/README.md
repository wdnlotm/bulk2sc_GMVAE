# Processing data for GMVAE training
The Python script here will read the raw count data from `_0_data_download` and prepare train (75%)-test(25%) split data for GMVAE training. Those split data will be saved into separate folders, `train` and `test`, respectively.
```
python process_train_test_data.py
```
