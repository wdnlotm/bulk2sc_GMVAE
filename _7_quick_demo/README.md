# Quick demo
The script and data files in this directory will demonstrate how the trained models can generate scRNA-seq data from bulk RNA-seq data. 

The `data_for_quick_demo` directory contains all the necessary data and model files for the demonstration. The file `lung_GMVAE_wholePTmodel.pt` is the trained GMVAE model and the file `model_scTAPE_lung.pt` is the trained `scTAPE` model--both trained on lung train data. The file `bulk_data_to_test.txt` is a pseudo bulk RNA-seq data aggregated from lung test data. It is unseen by the models, but it comes with the ground truth cell type proportions. The `scTAPE` model will first process this pseudo bulk RNA-seq data to predict cell type proportions, which will then be compared to the ground truth values. Then, the trained GMVAE model will generate scRNA-seq data with cell counts matching the predicted proportions.
