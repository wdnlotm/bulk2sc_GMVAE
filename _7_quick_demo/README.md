# Quick demo
The script files and data files in this directory will demonstrate how trained models work together. 

The `data_for_quick_demo` directory has all the data and model files for the demonstration. `lung_GMVAE_wholePTmodel.pt` has the trained GMVAE model and `model_scTAPE_lung.pt` has the trained scTAPE model. They are trained on the lung train data. The `bulk_data_to_test.txt` is a pseudo bulk RNA-seq data aggregated from the lung test data. So, it is unseen data from the model's point of view, but it comes with the ground truth cell type proportions. This pseudo bulk RNA-seq data will be fed to the scTAPE model to predict the cell type proportions. This will be compared with the ground truth proportions. Then, the trained GMVAE model will be asked to generated scRNA-seq data with matching cell count numbers to the predicted proportion.
